# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001: Use PyQt5 Instead of PyQt6

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need a mature, cross-platform GUI framework with rich widgets

**Decision**: Use PyQt5 5.15.11

**Rationale**:
- Mature ecosystem with extensive documentation
- Better backwards compatibility
- Proven stability on Windows/macOS
- Original project used PyQt5

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Stable, well-tested
- ✅ Large community support
- ⚠️ PyQt6 is newer but would require migration

---

## ADR-002: Use Ultralytics for SAM Integration

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to integrate Segment Anything Model 2 for semi-automated annotation

**Decision**: Use Ultralytics library instead of direct SAM2 installation

**Rationale**:
- Simplifies SAM model loading (single line)
- Includes PyTorch dependencies
- Automatic model caching
- No manual model download required
- Supports both SAM 2.0 and SAM 2.1 variants

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simplified installation (no separate SAM2 setup)
- ✅ Automatic model management
- ✅ Consistent API
- ⚠️ Dependency on Ultralytics release cycle

---

## ADR-003: Store Absolute Paths in Project Files

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Project files need to reference image locations

**Decision**: Store absolute paths to images in project JSON

**Rationale**:
- Images can be anywhere on filesystem
- No requirement to keep images with project file
- Simplifies project structure

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Flexible image locations
- ❌ Projects not portable between machines
- ❌ Moving images breaks projects

**Mitigation**: Export functions copy images to output directory

---

## ADR-004: No Automated Testing Framework

**Status**: Accepted (Technical Debt)

**Context**: Application is GUI-heavy with complex interactions

**Decision**: Rely on manual testing only

**Rationale**:
- PyQt testing requires significant setup (pytest-qt, fixtures)
- Visual nature of tool makes automated testing difficult
- Small development team
- Rapid iteration on features

**Consequences**:
- ❌ Risk of regressions
- ❌ Manual testing required for all changes
- ❌ Slower development velocity for large refactors
- ✅ Lower initial development overhead

**Future Consideration**: Add unit tests for utility functions (calculate_area, conversions)

---

## ADR-005: Disable Autosave During Project Loading

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Projects were getting corrupted when application terminated during loading (v0.8.9 bug)

**Decision**: Set `is_loading_project` flag to disable autosave during load

**Rationale**:
- Autosave triggered with partially loaded state corrupts file
- Loading large projects is slow, increases risk
- Simple flag prevents the issue

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Prevents project corruption
- ✅ Minimal code change
- ⚠️ Users lose autosave protection during load window

---

## ADR-006: Use Shapely for Polygon Operations

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to merge, validate, and manipulate polygon geometries

**Decision**: Use Shapely library for all polygon operations

**Rationale**:
- Industry-standard computational geometry library
- Handles invalid polygons gracefully
- Efficient union/intersection operations
- Well-tested algorithms

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Robust polygon handling
- ✅ Easy merge operations
- ✅ Automatic polygon validation
- ⚠️ Additional dependency

---

## ADR-007: Flatten Polygon Coordinates in Storage

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to store polygon annotations

**Decision**: Store as flattened list `[x1, y1, x2, y2, ...]` instead of nested `[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...]`

**Rationale**:
- Compatible with COCO JSON format
- Smaller file size
- Standard in annotation tools

**Consequences**:
- ✅ COCO compatibility
- ✅ Compact representation
- ⚠️ Must convert to/from paired format for some operations

---

## ADR-008: Support Multiple Export Formats

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Users need annotations in different formats for various ML frameworks

**Decision**: Implement exporters for COCO, YOLO, Pascal VOC, labeled images, semantic labels

**Rationale**:
- Different frameworks have different input requirements
- YOLO and COCO are most common
- Labeled images useful for visual verification
- Semantic labels needed for segmentation models

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Wide compatibility
- ✅ Flexible workflow
- ⚠️ More code to maintain
- ⚠️ Must keep up with format changes (e.g., YOLOv11)

---

## ADR-009: Use Per-Slice Annotation Storage for Multi-dimensional Images

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: TIFF stacks and CZI files have multiple slices that need individual annotations

**Decision**: Store annotations per slice with naming convention `{filename}_T{t}_Z{z}_C{c}`

**Rationale**:
- Each slice is effectively a separate 2D image
- Simple extension of existing single-image annotation
- User can navigate and annotate independently

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simple mental model (each slice = image)
- ✅ Reuses existing annotation code
- ⚠️ Large stacks create many entries in annotations dict
- ⚠️ No 3D annotation support

---

## ADR-010: Normalize 16-bit Images to 8-bit for Display

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: SAM and display require 8-bit images, but microscopy often uses 16-bit

**Decision**: Normalize 16-bit to 8-bit using percentile clipping

**Rationale**:
- SAM models trained on 8-bit RGB images
- Displays only show 8-bit effectively
- Percentile clipping (2nd-98th) provides better contrast than linear

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better visual contrast
- ✅ SAM compatibility
- ⚠️ Information loss (quantization)
- ⚠️ Different normalization per image/slice

---

## ADR-011: Run Torch-based Workers in Isolated Subprocesses

**Status**: Superseded by [ADR-013](#adr-013-in-process-inference-with-qthread-wrapping)

**Context**: Both SAM 2 (via Ultralytics) and Grounding DINO (via transformers) load PyTorch into the process. On Windows + Python 3.14, importing PyQt5 first and then loading PyTorch causes `WinError 1114` (DLL load order conflict between Qt and Torch native dependencies). The application is fundamentally PyQt5-based, so we cannot reorder these imports.

**Decision**: Run each ML model in its own subprocess script that has no PyQt5 imports — `sam_worker.py` for SAM and `dino_worker.py` for DINO. The parent GUI process speaks to each worker over stdin/stdout with JSON requests and responses.

**Rationale**:
- The DLL conflict only manifests when both libraries are loaded in the same process. Splitting them across processes avoids the issue entirely.
- Keeps the GUI responsive: heavy model loading doesn't block PyQt's event loop in the same address space.
- Lets us swap or upgrade torch/transformers/ultralytics versions without worrying about Qt interactions.
- The JSON-over-stdio protocol is simple, language-agnostic, and easy to debug — just inspect what the worker prints.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Works reliably on Windows + Python 3.14 (the original motivating bug)
- ✅ Worker scripts are PyQt-free; they can be tested independently
- ⚠️ Per-inference subprocess spawn cost (~1-2 s startup + first model load)
- ⚠️ Need UTF-8 forced on both ends of the pipe (`PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` in env, `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` on parent) — Windows cp1252 default crashes on non-ASCII bytes in torch warnings
- ⚠️ Two near-identical worker scripts to maintain (`sam_worker.py` mirrors the pattern from `dino_worker.py`)

**Superseded by**: Migrating to PyQt6 (ADR-013) eliminated the underlying DLL conflict. The subprocess hop, JSON marshalling, and `check_worker_isolation.py` tooling were removed in the same PR.

**Related**:
- Implementation (historical): `sam_utils.py` / `sam_worker.py`, `dino_utils.py` / `dino_worker.py`
- Original SAM-only version landed in #65 (Python 3.14 support)
- DINO subprocess pattern landed alongside the DINO feature

---

## ADR-012: Lazy Model Load on Dropdown Selection

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Both SAM and DINO model weights are large (SAM 2 tiny ~80 MB up to large ~400 MB; Grounding DINO base ~1.9 GB) and may not exist on first run. An earlier DINO flow required an explicit "Load" button click that did the resolve-or-download dance synchronously before the user could detect anything.

**Decision**: Selecting a model from the dropdown only updates state. Actual downloads happen on first use (first Detect call). UI feedback in the status label distinguishes "Ready: <model>" (weights present) from "<model> — will download on first detection".

**Rationale**:
- Matches the existing SAM behaviour (`change_sam_model` just stores the name; download happens in the worker).
- Removes a redundant click — one fewer thing for users to discover.
- Selecting a model the user picked by mistake is now free; only confirmed Detect triggers the (potentially heavy) download.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Consistent UX between the SAM and DINO panels
- ✅ Faster perceived startup; no spurious downloads from idle browsing
- ⚠️ First Detect after selection blocks the UI while download runs (~1 min for DINO base); the status label shows progress but the dialog is otherwise unresponsive
- ⚠️ No async download progress dialog — `huggingface_hub` prints to stdout

## ADR-013: In-process Inference with QThread Wrapping

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: ADR-011 introduced a subprocess hop for every SAM and DINO inference call to work around a PyQt5 + Torch DLL load-order conflict on Windows + Python 3.14. The workaround cost a fresh `python sam_worker.py` / `dino_worker.py` spawn per inference (~1-2 s warm latency, model reloaded from disk on every call) plus a temp-PNG marshal of the image.

Migrating the GUI from PyQt5 to PyQt6 (same PR) eliminates the DLL conflict — verified by `tools/check_pyqt6_torch_coexistence.py` importing PyQt6 → torch → transformers → ultralytics cleanly in one process on Windows+Py3.14 (the original failure case) and the Linux/macOS test matrix.

**Decision**: Run SAM and DINO inference directly inside the main Python process. Keep the model objects on the `SAMUtils` / `DINOUtils` singletons so they persist across calls. Wrap each inference in a short-lived `QThread` to keep the UI thread responsive; the public API blocks the caller via a nested `QEventLoop` so call sites in `annotator_window.py` stay synchronous-looking.

**Rationale**:
- The latency win is the whole point. Subprocess spawn + Python startup + model reload was ~1-2 s every call; in-process with a cached model is ~50-500 ms.
- Threading via a nested `QEventLoop` (the `_run_sync` helper in `sam_utils.py`) lets the calling thread keep pumping events — timers, repaints, progress dialog cancels still work — while inference runs on the QThread. Existing call sites need no refactor.
- Torch and transformers are imported lazily on first inference, so app startup stays fast for users who never touch SAM/DINO.
- `_qimage_to_numpy` already exists; converting the QImage on the calling thread (not on the worker) keeps Qt objects single-threaded as required.

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Each inference is ~1-2 s faster on Windows; less dramatic on macOS/Linux but still smoother.
- ✅ Cached model survives between calls — opening a DINO model once costs once.
- ✅ UI stays responsive during batch DINO+SAM runs (the calling thread's `QEventLoop` still processes events).
- ✅ One source of truth per model — no more keeping `sam_utils.py` and `sam_worker.py` aligned.
- ⚠️ A crash in torch (CUDA OOM, segfault) now takes the app down where the subprocess used to absorb it. Mitigation: inference is wrapped in `try/except` at the `_run_sync` boundary; the user sees an error dialog instead of a frozen UI.
- ⚠️ Model RAM stays resident until the user closes the app (or hits a future "Unload" menu item, scaffolded as `SAMUtils.unload()` / `DINOUtils.unload()`).
- ⚠️ Re-entrancy: because the calling thread keeps processing UI events during the wait, a user click on an un-disabled button can re-enter inference. Call sites that already disable buttons (batch DINO, model dropdown) are safe; single-click SAM relies on the SAM tool's own state flags. Acceptable for now; revisit if users hit it.

**Related**:
- Implementation: `sam_utils.py`, `dino_utils.py` (both refactored in the same PR that retires ADR-011).
- Smoke test: `tools/check_pyqt6_torch_coexistence.py` (gate that gated this whole change).
- Supersedes: [ADR-011](#adr-011-run-torch-based-workers-in-isolated-subprocesses).
